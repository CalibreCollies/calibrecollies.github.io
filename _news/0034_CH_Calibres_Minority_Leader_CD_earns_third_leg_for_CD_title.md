CH Calibre's Minority Leader CD earns third leg for CD title!
 Congratulations to Mom and Kizzy (CH Calibre's Minority Leader CD) for earning Kizzy's obedience title in record time! Kizzy was entered in three events, and garnered all three legs to obtain her title. 
 
 The last leg was earned in Troy, OH at Echo Hills Kennel Club of Ohio, Inc under Judge Mrs. Louise C. Botko.
 
 Way to go Mom and Kizzy, you made it look so easy!
