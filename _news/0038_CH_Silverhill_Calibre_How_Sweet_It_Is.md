CH Silverhill Calibre How Sweet It Is
 Gleason, CH Silverhill Calibre How Sweet It Is takes Best of Opposite Sex to the Variety over specials in Lexington for another 4 point major under Judge Betty Krause at the Bluegrass Classic Labor Day weekend. Gleason picked up two majors this weekend, finishing with four majors in all and more than enough points to complete her championship! 
 
 A HUGE THANK YOU to Forrest and Melanie Heese for allowing this girl to leave California and come to Kentucky!
