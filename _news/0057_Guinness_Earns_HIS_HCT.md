Guinness Earns HIS HCT!
 Calibre's World Record earned his HCT at a trial this weekend of September 6th - 7th. He is not quite eight months old yet. 
 
 Guinness is owned, trained, and campaigned by Alice Holm.
 
 Guiness is sired by CH Kimberee Under The Influence and is out of CH Calibre's Unforgettable (a CH Bethany's Preacher Man daughter).
