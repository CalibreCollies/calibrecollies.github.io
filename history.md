Calibre Collies began in 1978, under the former kennel name of Su-Mar Collies. Later it was changed to
Calibre Collies, and became the home for many smooth collie champions and pointed rough collies.

Calibre's Little Sister, a normal eyed, tri smooth bitch is the foundation of Calibre Collies. Weavil was with
me for a very long time, born July 31, 1997 and leaving us June 11, 2010. Her presence is missed by us all.

Calibre's Little Sister's get and grandchildren are producing beautifully, and are making her mark in the show
ring. She was unfortuantely not able to go into due to an accident. Watch for a Calibre Collie in the show ring
near you!
