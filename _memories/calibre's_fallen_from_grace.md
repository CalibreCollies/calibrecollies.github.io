Pagan (CH Calibre's Fallen From Grace) and her brother, Pete (Calibre's Double Trouble) are still sorely missed at
Calibre Collies. The two were inseparable.

Pagan was the dam of AM., INT., and NAT. CH Calibre's Angel of Music.

Pagan contracted Mycoplasma bacteria and passed away after a three year battle for her life. How she
contracted this bacteria is still unknown.
