title: CH Calibre's Cut From The Finest Cloth
---

Tahari, sired by Ch Corjalin The Whitelighter ex CH Calibre's Secret of Life.

I still put my hand down at my side and expect it to rest on your head. I miss your calming presence, and the way
you used to come to the other dogs rescue when I would scold them for being rotten.

You were definitely one in a million from the moment you arrived...thank you for 'The Dance'.
