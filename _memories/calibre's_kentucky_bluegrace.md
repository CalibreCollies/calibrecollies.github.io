This was the new beginning for Calibre Collies. Gracie, was from a litter of ten from a bitch I leased,
Sandland's Good Vibrations. She was sired by CH Spice Rack's Black Pepper. Gracie went on to produce CH
Calibre's Fallen From Grace (Pagan) and Calibre's Double Trouble (Pete) who played an intricate part of the
dogs you see carrying the Calibre kennel name.
