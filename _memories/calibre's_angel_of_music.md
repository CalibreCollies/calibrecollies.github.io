Chloe passed away May 23, 2007. She was another home bred Calibre Collie, CH Calibre's Fallen From Grace,(Pagan). She is back with her mother Pagan now, who always watched over her. She was loved by many, and will always be remembered by all who loved her in and out of the show circuits.

This is an untouched picture. This bitch was incredible, you could stack her, walk away, and when you came back she was still in the stack that you left her in.
