This is the beginning of letting go, just putting these dogs on this part of the website makes me cry...

My dear Hans, aka 'Uncle Daddy', always happy and light on your feet. I missed you swimming in the pool this year
and rolling in the water. I wish you peace my baby.

Hans was sired by CH Capella's Midnight Blues ex Calibre's Little Sister
